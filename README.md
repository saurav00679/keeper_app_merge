# keeper_app_merge
Project Description:

Welcome to the "Keeper App" web application! This project offers a user-friendly platform for managing daily notes and tasks. It consists of two integral submodules:

1. Keeper App (Frontend)

* The Keeper App, powered by React.js, serves as the frontend component, providing an intuitive and interactive user interface.
* Users can effortlessly register or log in using their credentials, gaining access to a feature-rich dashboard for note management.
* Within the Keeper App, users can create new notes, edit existing ones, and remove outdated entries with ease.
2. Server (Backend)

* Our robust Server submodule functions as the backend engine, facilitating secure user authentication and data management.
* Seamlessly integrated with MongoDB Atlas, it efficiently stores user data, including notes.
* User authentication ensures a personalized experience, while the server retrieves and displays previously saved notes.
* New notes generated by users are securely stored in the database, and deleted notes are promptly removed.

With this project, we aim to streamline your daily note-taking and organization tasks. The frontend and backend components work harmoniously to deliver a secure, efficient, and user-centric experience, simplifying your daily routine.
